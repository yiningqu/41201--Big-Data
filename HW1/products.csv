The same fellow who grew, roasted and brewed the beans. The taste was unlike any coffee I had ever had. Savory, rich and very smooth. No bitterness. I assumed this great taste was because I was on a coffee farm, like drinking wine in a vineyard. It turns out the secret to this flavor was how heat was used in roasting. I knew then that I wanted to learn how to create a coffee that is pure to the art of roasting. Puroast Coffee. After a long journey, we found the right flavor and Puroast Coffee was born. So my brother and I start selling Puroast in local stores in California, people loved the taste and then we find out thereâ€™s a lot more to the story. Mixed in with the compliments about taste, we received comments telling us Puroast Coffee didnâ€™t upset customersâ€™ stomachs or aggravate their heartburn. There were so many of these comments that we decided to find out if there was something different about Puroast which would be a significant benefit. We discovered there was a big difference in Puroast. Not only does our roasting recipe make for a smoother taste, it also greatly reduces the acid in the coffee by more than 70% compared to leading brands. 70% less acid than other coffees! This isnâ€™t just me saying this, itâ€™s Dr. Shibamoto and scientific research team from the University of California/Davis. Dr. Shibamoto found that in reducing acid levels, our roasting process dramatically increased the amount of antioxidants. And by dramatic I mean by 5 times more than other leading coffees and 7 times more than green tea. 7 times more antioxidants than green tea! You will discover what I did on that Venezuelan coffee farm, along with Puroast Coffeeâ€™s exquisite flavor, the benefits of lower acid and rich levels of antioxidants will bring you enjoyment like no other coffee youâ€™ve ever had."B000EVOSE4,Haribo,"Haribo Gummy Gold Bears Candy is soft, chewy and translucent.

While Irish Breakfast is usually blended with an Assam tea base, our Super Irish Breakfast has even more Assam, which makes the tea maltier, richer and more full-bodied.  Assam is a district in northeastern India that lies on the Indian-Burmese border. It produces more black tea than any other area on earth, with the exception of a few places in China. Assams tea gardens cover some four hundred thousand acres of verdant rolling plains on both sides of the mighty Brahmaputra River.  The other black tea used in our Super Irish Breakfast blend is Ceylon. Ceylon-or its contemporary name Sri Lanka-is a beautiful tropical island that lies just twenty-two miles off the southern tip of India. Sri Lanka supplies about 25% of the worlds tea. The nearly six hundred thousand acres of tea under cultivation provide well over half of the islands export earnings.    View larger    More Stash Tea Flavors to Try!

We begin with Mutan White (White Peony) which is made from the leaves of the da bai or ""big white"" bush and mixed with buds from the shui hsien or ""water sprite"" tea plant. The leaves have silver tips and are predominantly greenish-brown in color and very flat. The buds are lustrous, soft and silvery. Its name, a literal translation from the Chinese, probably comes from the very pale color of its liquor.  We then blend this white tea with green tea from Japan, China and India.

By blending premium white tea with cinnamon, whole cloves, cardamom, ginger root and cassia, we created a flavorful and spicy tea that goes well with a splash of milk and sweetener.  Originally from China, white tea is simply withered and dried, causing a very light oxidation. Its flavor is most similar to that of green tea, but is usually more creamy, soft and sweet. Green tea production endeavors to avoid the oxidation of the tea leaves, in order to retain its natural green color and fresh flavor. In Japan, the leaves are steamed, while other countries will pan-fire or dry it through other methods. It has a more delicate flavor than black tea and often brews up pale green or golden in color.      View larger    More Stash Tea Flavors to Try!

Today, Stash Tea Company is one of the largest specialty tea companies in the United States. The company derives its name from an entertaining aspect of tea folklore. In earlier centuries, tea was a valuable commodity traditionally transported by clipper ship. The shipâ€™s captain often was presented with some of the finest teas for his personal use.

Since cats do not have a strong thirst drive, it is important for a cat to ingest water with his or her food. Wellness wet cat recipes are a delicious and healthy way to increase your cats moisture intake. Wellness Canned Cat RecipesWellness Canned Recipes provide sources of protein and essential fatty acids. Theyâ€™re made with high quality proteins and are free of added growth hormones and steroids. Recipes also include ingredients like sweet potatoes and carrots, essential vitamins and minerals, and fresh, whole cranberries and blueberries are added to help maintain proper urinary tract health.  Importance of Good HydrationWater is an essential nutrient for your cat and accounts for 60-75% of an adult catâ€™s body weight. Water helps your catâ€™s body digest food, regulate body temperature, eliminate waste (urinary issues continue to be one of the most common medical reasons pet parents take their cats to the veterinarian each year) and allows salt and other electrolytes to pass through the body. Encouraging hydration is extremely important. Providing a bowl of fresh, clean water does not ensure your cat will naturally drink what they need in order to stay properly hydrated and healthy. Tips to Encourage Healthy Hydration:1. Many cats love to drink running water. Re-circulating water fountains are very attractive water stations that, in many cases, will stimulate a cat to drink more frequently.2. Try moving the water from one location to another regularly as sometimes a new location can help to stimulate cats to drink.3. If your cat has had urinary problems in the past, canned foods should be a major part of their diet. You can even add more water to your catâ€™s canned food to encourage increased water intake. 4. Multiple, clean, fresh litter boxes should be placed in out of the way areas, making it easy for your cat to relieve himself without interruption.
